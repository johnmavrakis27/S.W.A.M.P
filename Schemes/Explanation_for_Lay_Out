Due to limitations in the application used to make the connections lay out we need to make some clarifications on the devicies shown in the scheme 
because the program did not have the devices we are actually using so we had to replace them with similar devices that were in the program

The following devices are changed
The Arduino Nano is the Jetson Nano
The Arduino Uno is the BBC Micro:Bit Controller

The Proucts we used to create Shrek v2 are the following:
Jetson Nano: It runs the main algorthims for both runs as well as the algorithm used to take photos for the AI training process

BBC Micro:Bit Controller: Controls the servo motor and communicates with the Jetson with serial communication. 
               Also used to connect with the joystick during the AI training process for Run 2
               
Raspberry Cam v2: Takes the photos that are used in the AI algorithm to decide the turn direction of the car

11.1V LiPo Battery: Powers everything

BMMISO Compass: Used in Run 1 to read the direction the car is facing and helps it stay in a straght line
                in between the corrner sections as well as reach the desiered angle when turning

GROOVE Color Sensor: Used in Run 1 to see the colored lines and let the car know that it is entering a corner

HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors: One in either side of the car. Used in Run 1 to see the cars distance from the side walls

OLED Display: Displays the menu

Step-Down Converter: 

Servo Motor

DC Motor
